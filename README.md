# Editor
Terminal editor in rust. Currently a work in progress.

## To Do
* widget everything
* add file tree to side
    * add more functionality to file tree
        * refactor functions and system
* mouse usage
* enable safe shutdown
* issue with empty file
* adding deletion actions
    * add actions, like delete, to motions
* improve error handling
* improve/fix testing suite
* improve tree sitter working
    * improve syntax highlighting with tree-sitter
        * improve performance
        * add basic color schemes
* arrow key movement for buffer and command line
* fix all todos and fixes in proj
* later implement ptr_x for longer lines
* add f/F/t/T
* copy/paste
* ~improve commands ui

## Ideas
* add highlighting/visual mode
* windows from multi buffer view
    * simply start with two per window
